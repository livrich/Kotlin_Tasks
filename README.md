# Kotlin_Tasks
CSE 222 B


## Task Instructions
Like last week, please download the tasks.kt and main.kt files for this week's assignment and create a Kotlin 
project that contains these two files. You should not modify main.kt in any way. Your tasks are in comments in 
tasks.kt. Each time you successfully compile and run, the test functions in main.kt will test your progress and 
report which tasks are successfully completed, which are currently failing on all of the tests.

Your goal is to write code in tasks.kt so that all tasks are passing.

## Project Instructions
Brainstorm and create a small project that may take about 2-3 hours to complete. Since the purpose of this project
is to demonstrate some of what you have learned in this course, your project is expected to include use of at least 
5 of the following 12 things you learned about in the course:
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Nullables
* Enumerations
* Lambdas
* Classes
* Data Classes
* Child Classes
* Pair
* Triple
* Interfaces
